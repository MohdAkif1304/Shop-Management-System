#### Introduction to the Online Shopping System Project

The Online Shopping System is a C++ application designed to simulate an e-commerce platform's basic functionalities. Developed using classes and binary file handling, this system enables users to perform various actions, such as adding products to a virtual shopping cart, viewing the cart contents, removing items, and proceeding to checkout for payment.

#### Key Features:
- **Product Management:** Users can add products to the system by providing details such as ID, name, price, and quantity.
- **Shopping Cart Operations:** The system allows users to manage their shopping cart by adding items, removing selected products, and viewing the cart contents.
- **Checkout and Payment:** Users can proceed to checkout, view the total price of items in the cart, and simulate payment (actual payment processing not implemented in this version).

#### How It Works:
- **Classes:** Utilizes classes such as `Product` and `ShoppingCart` to organize and manage product information and cart operations.
- **File Handling:** Stores product and cart data in binary files (`cart.bin`) for persistence between sessions.

#### Usage:
- Users interact with the system through a simple command-line interface, where they navigate through a menu to perform various actions related to shopping.

This project serves as a foundation for an online shopping system, demonstrating core functionalities using C++ programming concepts like classes and file handling.
